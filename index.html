                    Apples are crisp and versatile, come in a spectrum of colors, and flavors from tart to sweet.
                    They're
                    beloved
                    for their
                    crunchy texture and are perfect for snacking, baking into pies, or pressing into cider.

                <p>
                    Pineapples are tropical and tangy, crowned with a spiky tuft and hide a succulent, golden flesh
                    within.
                    Their sweet-tart
                    taste evokes sunny beaches and is ideal for refreshing juices, grilling, or adding a tropical twist
                    to
                    salads.

                    Kiwis have vibrant green flesh speckled with tiny seeds. They offer a zesty-sweet flavor reminiscent
                    of strawberries and melons, perfect for eating as is or slicing into fruit salads.

                    breakfast
                    bowls. Each berry is dotted with tiny seeds and embodies summer's essence in every bite.

                <p>
                    Bananas are creamy and mild, and offer a smooth texture and mildly sweet flavor. They're a go-to
                    fruit for
                    quick energy,
                    blending into smoothies, or adding natural sweetness to baked goods.

                <p>
                    Oranges boast a refreshing juiciness and bright flavor. Their vibrant hue and
                    easy-to-peel skin make them a favorite for snacking, juicing, or incorporating into both sweet and
                    savory
                    dishes.
